# 🌳 Red-Black Tree Visualizer

A web-based **Red-Black Tree Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project helps visualize how **insertion**, **color flipping**, and **rotations** work in a Red-Black Tree — one of the most important self-balancing binary search trees in computer science.

## 🧠 About Red-Black Trees

A **Red-Black Tree (RBT)** is a type of **self-balancing binary search tree** that ensures the height of the tree remains approximately `O(log n)` after each operation, allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.

### 🔑 Key Properties:
1. Every node is either **Red** or **Black**  
2. The **root** is always **Black**  
3. Every **leaf (NULL)** is considered **Black**  
4. A **Red** node cannot have a **Red** child  
5. Every path from the root to a leaf has the **same number of black nodes**

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- 🧩 Node **deletion** visualization  
- ⏸️ Step-by-step **animation controls**  
- 🌈 **Dark / Light mode** toggle  
- 📱 Improved **mobile responsiveness**  
- 🧾 Option to **export tree structure** as JSON
