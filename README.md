# 🌳 Red-Black Tree Visualizer

A web-based **Red-Black Tree Visualizer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps visualize how insertion and balancing work in Red-Black Trees — one of the most important self-balancing binary search trees in computer science.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Insert nodes dynamically** into the tree  
- 🔄 **Automatic color balancing & rotations** visualization  
- 🎨 Clean, interactive, and responsive UI  
- 🧠 Educational tool for understanding tree balancing algorithms  
- ⚡ Instant visual feedback for every operation  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — structure  
- **CSS3** — styling & layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — logic and tree visualization  
- *(Optional)* — D3.js or Canvas (if you used for drawing nodes)

🧠 Learn About Red-Black Trees

A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) that ensures the tree height remains approximately O(log n) after every insertion and deletion.

Key Properties:

Every node is either Red or Black

The root is always Black

Every leaf (NULL) is considered Black

If a node is Red, its children are Black

Every path from root to leaf has the same number of black nodes

🛠️ Future Improvements

🔧 Node deletion visualization

⏩ Step-by-step animation controls (Next / Back)

🌈 Color themes (Dark mode / Light mode)

📱 Better mobile responsiveness
